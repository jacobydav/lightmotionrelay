# lightmotionrelay
Project files for the motion and light activated relay.

When it is dark and the sensor detects motion it turns on. This is useful for LED based projects that you
don't want to turn on and off manually.

The motion sensor is a cheap PIR sensor on a breakout board. I bought it on eBay.
